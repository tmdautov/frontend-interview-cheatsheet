## JS theory

### What are the data types in JavaScript?

> There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript

- **Primitive (7 types)**
  - `String`
  - `Number`
  - `Boolean`
  - `BigInt`
  - `null`
  - `undefined`
  - `Symbol`
- **Non-primitive (1 type)**
  - `Object`: This is the base type for more complex structures like Arrays, Functions, and other objects

### What is the Hoisting?

> Hoisting is a Javascript default behavior of moving functions, variables or classes declarations on top of the module/function level scope before executing the code.

- Function declarations are hoists, while function expressions are not

```js
// This is function declaration
function foo() { ... }

// This is function expression
var bar = function () { ... }
```

- Variables hoisting
  - Variables declared with `var` hoisted to the top of its functional or global scope, but the initialization is not. If you try to use a variable before it is declared and initialized, it will have the value `undefined`.
  - Variables declared with `let` and `const` hoisted, but they are not initialized with a default value. Accessing them before the actual declaration results in a `ReferenceError`. This is often referred to as the "temporal dead zone."

```js
console.log(a); // undefined, due to hoisting
var a = 5;

console.log(b); // ReferenceError: b is not defined
let b = 3;
```

### What is the Closure?

- Closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope.

- Closures can be used to emulate private properties and methods.
- Every JavaScript function creates a new `lexical environment`. This environment has a reference to its outer environment, forming a scope chain
- The scope chain is a process of how Javascript looks for variables. When code needs to access a variable, JavaScript looks at the current scope. If not found, it moves up the scope chain to the outer scope and continues until it reaches the global scope. If the variable is still not found, a reference error is thrown.

**Example: Counter**

```js
function getCounter() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function() {
    return counter++;
  }
}

let count = getCounter();
console.log(count());  // 0
console.log(count());  // 1
console.log(count());  // 2
```
